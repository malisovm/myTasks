This is a Kanban-style task manager written in React/Typescript (frontend) and Express/MongoDB (backend).

Live version [here](https://mytasks-react.cyclic.app/).

The [/dev](https://github.com/malisovm/mytasks_react) branch can be launched with `npm run start` + `cd backend && node server.js`. If you want to run build, remove the proxy line from package.json and uncomment lines 5-8 in server.js. The compiled version is in the [/deploy](https://github.com/malisovm/mytasks_react/tree/deploy) branch.
